            <h2>What is Starblast Launcher?</h2>
            <p>Are you sick of changing applications to switch between different Starblast versions? Starblast Launcher solves this problem! This application lets you easily switch between different versions of the game with just a few clicks.</p>
            
            <p>This idea came from Adonys (<span class="highlight">_adonys</span> on Discord) and was developed to make the Starblast experience smoother and more convenient.</p>
