        <div class="content">
            <h1 class="contentheader">About</h1>
            <p>This Bot started as a one file Bot. While coding a simple moderation bot for an big discord server this bot became more and more advanced. While programming the staff team gave me great ideas to implement.
                One day the file became so big that i knew i couldn't leave the bot in one simple single file so i started creating handlers and functions for a better overview.</p>
            <p>Basically this bot just blocks words that you can add to it's blacklist using simple commands. I knew just words wouldn't be enough so i added an advanced feature to add entire regexes to the bot, allowing you to block messages with weard content like websites.
                To always inform other Staff member's, a log channel is required where when adding or removing a word/regex the bot logs it. Once a user sends content that is in the bots blacklist, the message gets deleted and the user gets kicked.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>This Bot uses Discord.JS V14, instead of using online databases to save data i made it easier for you and just added two text files where everything will be saved.</p>
